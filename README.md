The Source Analysis Recommender is a sophisticated computational pipeline designed to identify and analyze potential source relationships between classical philosophical texts. This system bridges computational linguistics with traditional philological methods to provide evidence-based insights into the transmission of philosophical ideas across linguistic and cultural boundaries, assisting scholars in discovering overlooked textual connections and influences.

<a id="what"></a>
## 📜 What is Source Analysis?

Source analysis in classical and medieval philosophy examines how philosophical ideas were transmitted, transformed, and developed across time, languages, and cultures. It investigates:

- The philosophical context in which a given text should be interpreted
- The textual lineage of philosophical works (which texts influenced others)
- How concepts and arguments were borrowed, adapted, or critiqued
- Hidden influences that may not be explicitly acknowledged by authors

## ⚠️ Problem Statement

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="70%">
      <h3>Challenges in Source Analysis</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Labor-Intensive Process:</strong> Traditional source analysis is labor-intensive and limited by human capacity to process large text corpora</li>
        <li><strong>Cross-Linguistic Barriers:</strong> Cross-linguistic influences (particularly Greek-Arabic) are understudied due to language barriers</li>
        <li><strong>Hidden Connections:</strong> Many textual relationships remain hidden due to the limitations of manual analysis</li>
        <li><strong>Confirmation Bias:</strong> Manual analysis can be influenced by individual scholar perspectives and preconceptions</li>
        <li><strong>Fragmentary Sources:</strong> Original sources are often fragmentary or lost entirely</li>
        <li><strong>Non-Standard Citations:</strong> Authors frequently didn't cite sources according to modern conventions</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Our Solution</h3>
      <p>Leverage LLMs (Claude and OpenAI) to augment scholarly analysis while maintaining rigorous academic standards, creating a systematic approach that helps reduce confirmation bias in source identification</p>

## ⚙️ Three-Stage Pipeline

This system employs a sophisticated three-stage pipeline that progressively refines the analysis:

<div align="center">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th width="20%">Stage</th>
      <th width="40%">Focus</th>
      <th width="40%">Output</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="center"><h3>1️⃣</h3><strong>Thematizer</strong></td>

      <td>In-depth analysis</td>
      <td>Detailed influence assessment</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<br>

The following sections demonstrate each stage of the pipeline with concrete examples of inputs, processes, and outputs for each stage, starting with the Thematizer.

<a id="stage1"></a>
## 🧠 Stage 1: Thematizer

<div align="center">
  <img src="pictures/Bekker_1831_page184.jpg" alt="Bekker Edition of Aristotle" width="500"/>
  <p><em>Page from Bekker's edition of Aristotle's works (1831), showing the type of texts analyzed by our system</em></p>
</div>

### Purpose

The Thematizer performs initial broad analysis of individual texts to identify themes, structure, and key concepts. It serves as the foundation for all subsequent analysis by creating comprehensive thematic profiles for each text.

### Database Example: Classical Greek Text (Aristotle)

<div align="center">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <pre>
Περι ποιητικῆς αὐτῆς τε καὶ τῶν εἰδῶν αὐτῆς, ἥν τινα δύναμιν ἕκαστον ἔχει, καὶ πῶς 
δεῖ συνίστασθαι τοὺς μύθους, εἰ μέλλει καλῶς ἕξειν ἡ ποίησις, ἔτι δὲ ἐκ πόσων καὶ 
ποίων ἐστὶ μορίων, ὁμοίως δὲ καὶ περὶ τῶν ἄλλων ὅσα τῆς αὐτῆς ἐστὶ μεθόδου, λέγωμεν, 
ἀρξάμενοι κατὰ φύσιν πρῶτον ἀπὸ τῶν πρώτων. Ἐποποιία δὴ καὶ ἡ τῆς τραγῳδίας ποίησις, 
ἔτι δὲ κωμῳδία καὶ ἡ διθυραμβοποιητικὴ καὶ τῆς αὐλητικῆς ἡ πλείστη καὶ κιθαριστικῆς, 
πᾶσαι τυγχάνουσιν οὖσαι μιμήσεις τὸ σύνολον.
        </pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="center"><em>Classical Greek text from Aristotle's "Ars Poetica Περὶ ποιητικῆς Kitāb fī l-šiʿr"</em></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

### Input Example: Classical Arabic Text (Al-Farabi)

<div align="center">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <pre>
وأما الشعر فإنه كلام مخيل مؤلف من أقوال لها إيقاعات متساوية، وهذه الأقوال 
متساوية الأجزاء عند العرب متفقة الأواخر، وعند اليونانيين متساوية في الأزمنة 
متفقة الأوزان، وكل قول منها عند العرب يسمى بيتا، وعند اليونانيين يسمى الواحد 
منها فاصلة، وعند كثير من الأمم يسمى الواحد منها سطرا.
        </pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="center"><em>Classical Arabic text from Al-Farabi's "Risālah fī qawānīn ṣināʿat al-šuʿarāʾ"</em></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

### Process

The Thematizer follows these steps:

1. **Text Preparation**
   - Ingests raw text files from input and database directories
   - Validates file structure and creates organized directory for outputs
   - Splits large texts into manageable chunks (approximately 20,000 characters)

2. **API Analysis**
   - Processes each text chunk using Claude 3.5 Sonnet
   - Applies specialized prompt engineering for philosophical text analysis
   - Identifies author, title, text type, themes, and structural elements
   - Generates scholarly abstracts for each text chunk

3. **Result Compilation**
   - Merges analyses from multiple chunks with intelligent deduplication
   - Combines abstracts and consolidates themes
   - Identifies natural breaks and section divisions
   - Generates comprehensive thematic profiles

1. **Loads and Processes Thematic Data**
   - Reads JSON outputs from the Thematizer
   - Identifies potential text pairs for comparison based on thematic overlap

2. **Performs Multi-Stage Analysis**
   - Loads relevant text pairs

```
Analyze the textual evidence for transmission and influence between these texts:

Text 1:
Author: {input_metadata.get('author', 'Unknown')}
Title: {input_metadata.get('title', 'Unknown')}
Type: {input_metadata.get('text_type', 'Unknown')}

Text 2:
Database Text: {comparison['database_file']}

Existing Analysis:
{json.dumps(comparison['analysis'], indent=2)}

Please analyze the concrete textual evidence for:
1. Direct textual dependencies:
   - Exact quotations or close paraphrases
   - Shared examples or illustrations
   - Similar structural organization
   - Common reference points

2. Conceptual dependencies:
   - Shared philosophical frameworks
   - Similar problem-solving approaches
   - Common argumentative patterns
   - Parallel theoretical constructs

3. Evidence of mediation:
   - References to other texts or authorities
   - Use of standard terminology or definitions
   - Common sources cited or alluded to
   - Shared technical vocabulary

4. Adaptation indicators:
   - Modifications of concepts or arguments
   - Contextual adjustments
   - Elaborations or simplifications
   - Novel applications of ideas

Focus only on evidence present in the texts themselves. Avoid speculating about historical transmission paths unless explicitly referenced in the texts.

Respond in JSON format with these fields:
{
    "textual_dependencies": ["dependency1", "dependency2", ...],
    "conceptual_dependencies": ["dependency1", "dependency2", ...],

## 🏆 Conclusion

The Source Analysis Recommender represents a significant step forward in computational approaches to philosophical text analysis. By combining the strengths of AI with traditional scholarly methods, it offers new possibilities for understanding the complex relationships between texts across time, language, and tradition.

This project demonstrates the potential of thoughtful AI integration in humanities research—not replacing human scholars, but augmenting their capabilities and opening new avenues for discovery.
