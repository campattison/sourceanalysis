<a id="stage1"></a>
## 🧠 Stage 1: Thematizer

<div align="center">
  <img src="pictures/Bekker_1831_page184.jpg" alt="Bekker Edition of Aristotle" width="500"/>
  <p><em>Page from Bekker's edition of Aristotle's works (1831), showing the type of texts analyzed by our system</em></p>
</div>

### Purpose

The Thematizer performs initial broad analysis of individual texts to identify themes, structure, and key concepts. It serves as the foundation for all subsequent analysis by creating comprehensive thematic profiles for each text.

### Input Example: Classical Arabic Text (Al-Farabi)

<div align="center">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <pre>
وأما الشعر فإنه كلام مخيل مؤلف من أقوال لها إيقاعات متساوية، وهذه الأقوال 
متساوية الأجزاء عند العرب متفقة الأواخر، وعند اليونانيين متساوية في الأزمنة 
متفقة الأوزان، وكل قول منها عند العرب يسمى بيتا، وعند اليونانيين يسمى الواحد 
منها فاصلة، وعند كثير من الأمم يسمى الواحد منها سطرا.
        </pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="center"><em>Classical Arabic text from Al-Farabi's "Risālah fī qawānīn ṣināʿat al-šuʿarāʾ"</em></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

### Process

The Thematizer follows these steps:

1. **Text Preparation**
   - Ingests raw text files from input and database directories
   - Validates file structure and creates organized directory for outputs
   - Splits large texts into manageable chunks (approximately 20,000 characters)

2. **AI Analysis**
   - Processes each text chunk using Claude 3.5 Sonnet
   - Applies specialized prompt engineering for philosophical text analysis
   - Identifies author, title, text type, themes, and structural elements
   - Generates scholarly abstracts for each text chunk

3. **Result Compilation**
   - Merges analyses from multiple chunks with intelligent deduplication
   - Combines abstracts and consolidates themes
   - Identifies natural breaks and section divisions
   - Generates comprehensive thematic profiles

### AI Prompt Used

## 🔍 Stage 2: Source Analyzer

### Purpose

The Source Analyzer compares texts to identify potential relationships and influences between them. It takes the thematic profiles generated by the Thematizer and performs pairwise comparisons to detect verbal parallels, conceptual similarities, and methodological connections.

### Input Example

The Source Analyzer takes two thematic profiles as input:

1. **Text A (Potential Source)**: Thematic profile of Aristotle's "Poetics"
```json
{
  "author": "Aristotle",
  "title": "Poetics",
  "text_type": "original text",
  "themes": [
    "Mimesis (imitation) as the foundation of poetry",
    "Classification of poetic forms (tragedy, comedy, epic)",
    "Structure and elements of tragedy",
    "Catharsis as emotional purification",
    "Unity of plot and action",
    "Character development in drama",
    "Relationship between poetry and truth"
  ],
  "abstract": "Aristotle's Poetics establishes a systematic theory of poetry and drama, focusing primarily on tragedy. The text defines poetry as mimesis (imitation) and analyzes how different poetic forms imitate reality through various means. Aristotle examines the structure of tragedy, identifying its six essential components: plot, character, thought, diction, melody, and spectacle. He emphasizes the primacy of plot and the importance of unity, completeness, and magnitude in dramatic composition. The work also discusses the psychological effects of tragedy, introducing the concept of catharsis as emotional purification through pity and fear."
}
```

2. **Text B (Text Under Analysis)**: Thematic profile of Al-Farabi's "Risālah fī qawānīn ṣināʿat al-šuʿarāʾ"
```json
{
  "author": "Al-Farabi",
  "title": "Risālah fī qawānīn ṣināʿat al-šuʿarāʾ",
  "text_type": "treatise",
  "themes": [
    "Definition and nature of poetry",
    "Comparative poetics (Arabic vs. Greek traditions)",
    "Metrical systems and rhythmic patterns",
    "Imaginative discourse and its effects",
    "Poetry as logical argumentation",
    "Classification of poetic forms",
    "Relationship between poetry and truth"
  ],
  "abstract": "Al-Farabi's text presents a systematic analysis of poetics, defining poetry as imaginative discourse with rhythmic patterns. It compares Arabic and Greek poetic traditions, highlighting differences in metrical systems while identifying universal elements of poetic composition. The text establishes a philosophical framework for understanding poetry as a form of logical discourse with specific effects on the soul."
}
```

### Process Workflow

1. **Loads and Validates Data**
   - Reads JSON outputs from the Thematizer
   - Validates data structure and required fields
   - Prepares text pairs for comparison

2. **Performs AI-Powered Analysis**
   - Constructs specialized prompts for Claude 3.5 Sonnet
   - Sends paired texts for comparative analysis
   - Processes and validates AI responses

3. **Generates Structured Results**
   - Creates standardized JSON output
   - Calculates confidence scores based on multiple factors
   - Organizes evidence by category (verbal, conceptual, methodological)

### AI Prompt Used

<div align="center">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <pre>
You are a comparative philosophical analyst with expertise in identifying textual relationships 
between ancient Greek and Arabic philosophical works. Your task is to compare two philosophical 
texts and assess potential influence or relationship.

TEXT A (Potential Source):
{
  "author": "{{text_a.author}}",
  "title": "{{text_a.title}}",
  "text_type": "{{text_a.text_type}}",
  "themes": {{text_a.themes|json}},
  "abstract": "{{text_a.abstract}}"
}

TEXT B (Text Under Analysis):
{
  "author": "{{text_b.author}}",
  "title": "{{text_b.title}}",
  "text_type": "{{text_b.text_type}}",
  "themes": {{text_b.themes|json}},
  "abstract": "{{text_b.abstract}}"
}

Please analyze these texts for evidence of influence or relationship, focusing on:

1. Verbal parallels:
   - Similar terminology or phrasing
   - Shared examples or illustrations
   - Comparable definitions of key concepts

2. Conceptual parallels:
   - Similar philosophical ideas or arguments
   - Comparable theoretical frameworks
   - Shared philosophical problems or questions

3. Methodological similarities:
   - Similar analytical approaches
   - Comparable organizational structures
   - Shared reasoning patterns or logical methods

4. Influence assessment:
   - Evaluate the likelihood of direct influence (scale 0.0-1.0)
   - Consider historical context and transmission pathways
   - Assess alternative explanations for similarities

Provide specific evidence for each category and explain your confidence score.

  Historical evidence confirms that Al-Farabi had access to Aristotle's Poetics 
  through the translation tradition, and his other works show similar patterns 
  of engagement with Aristotelian texts. The score is not higher (e.g., 0.95) 
  because some similarities could be attributed to shared philosophical tradition

  significant innovations not found in Aristotle."

## 🔬 Stage 3: Deep Analyzer

### Purpose

The Deep Analyzer performs in-depth analysis of high-confidence matches identified by the Source Analyzer. It focuses on text pairs with high confidence scores (≥0.7) and provides detailed evidence-based assessment of influence patterns.

### Input Example

The Deep Analyzer takes as input the results from the Source Analyzer:

```json
{
  "comparisons": [
    {
      "input_file": "aristotle_poetics.txt",
      "database_file": "alfarabi_poetics.txt",
      "relevance_score": 0.85,
      "analysis": {
        "verbal_parallels": ["..."],
        "conceptual_parallels": ["..."],
        "methodological_parallels": ["..."],
        "technical_vocabulary": ["..."],
        "analysis_summary": "...",
        "confidence_score": 0.85,
        "recommended_research": ["..."]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Process

The Deep Analyzer follows these steps:

1. **Load Previous Analysis**
   - Retrieves results from the Source Analyzer
   - Filters for high-confidence comparisons (≥0.7)

2. **Analyze Transmission Patterns**
   - Examines direct textual dependencies
   - Identifies conceptual dependencies
   - Looks for evidence of mediation
   - Identifies adaptation indicators

3. **Analyze Philosophical Development**
   - Examines argument structure
   - Analyzes conceptual frameworks
   - Evaluates methodological approaches
   - Identifies philosophical innovations

4. **Analyze Linguistic Transformation**
   - Examines technical terminology
   - Analyzes argumentative language
   - Evaluates conceptual expression
   - Identifies textual organization patterns

5. **Generate Comprehensive Report**
   - Combines all analyses
   - Calculates aggregate confidence scores
   - Provides detailed evidence for each finding

### Technical Implementation

The Deep Analyzer is implemented as a Python module that:

1. **Loads Source Analyzer Results**
   - Retrieves the latest analysis results
   - Filters for high-confidence matches (≥0.7)

2. **Makes API Calls to OpenAI**
   - Uses the o3-mini model
   - Implements retry logic for reliability
   - Processes structured JSON responses

3. **Performs Three Types of Analysis**
   - Transmission pattern analysis
   - Philosophical development analysis
   - Linguistic transformation analysis

4. **Generates Detailed Reports**
   - Creates comprehensive analysis reports
   - Saves results with timestamps
   - Maintains symlinks to latest results

### AI Prompt Example

Here's an example of the prompt used for transmission pattern analysis:

```
Analyze the textual evidence for transmission and influence between these texts:

Text 1:
Author: [Author]
Title: [Title]
Type: [Text Type]

Text 2:
Database Text: [Database File]

Existing Analysis:
[Previous Analysis JSON]

Please analyze the concrete textual evidence for:
1. Direct textual dependencies:
   - Exact quotations or close paraphrases
   - Shared examples or illustrations
   - Similar structural organization
   - Common reference points

2. Conceptual dependencies:
   - Shared philosophical frameworks
   - Similar problem-solving approaches
   - Common argumentative patterns
   - Parallel theoretical constructs

3. Evidence of mediation:
   - References to other texts or authorities
   - Use of standard terminology or definitions
   - Common sources cited or alluded to
   - Shared technical vocabulary

4. Adaptation indicators:
   - Modifications of concepts or arguments
   - Contextual adjustments
   - Elaborations or simplifications
   - Novel applications of ideas

Focus only on evidence present in the texts themselves. Avoid speculating about historical transmission paths unless explicitly referenced in the texts.

Respond in JSON format with these fields:
- textual_dependencies: List of concrete textual parallels and dependencies
- conceptual_dependencies: List of shared philosophical frameworks and approaches
- mediation_evidence: List of references and shared sources found in the texts
- adaptation_evidence: List of documented modifications and adjustments
- evidence_strength: 0.0-1.0 score for the strength of textual evidence
- key_passages: List of specific passages that demonstrate the relationships
```

### Output Example

The Deep Analyzer generates a structured report with detailed findings:
